* Setup Greenplum6 Cluster
Before start, you need download  RHEL8 RPM package from Pviotal ( https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-gpdb/ ) and save it in this folder.
** Build docker image
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker build . -t mygreenplum7
#+END_SRC
** Modify Cluster config
Default cluster has 1 master, 2 segment and 1 etl host. you can change it by editing the docker-compose.yaml file.
** Start container
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC
** Start Greenplum cluster
*** Login to cluster
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh -p 7222 gpadmin@127.0.0.1
#+END_SRC
Password is changeme
*** Config greenplum file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
artifact/prepare.sh -s 3 -n 2
#+END_SRC
- **s** means there are 3 segment containers (sdw1 to sdw3)
- **n** means there are 2 primary segments on each container.

It will create config file for gpinitsystem. Run following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gpinitsystem -a -c gpinitsystem_config
#+END_SRC
Now you can access your Greenplu with psql or other clients.
*** Manage cluster
Script **prepare.sh**  will also create file **env.sh** that we can source for Greenplum enviroments.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
source env.sh
gpstop -a
gpstart -a
#+END_SRC
